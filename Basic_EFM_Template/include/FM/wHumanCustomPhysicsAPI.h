ED_FM_EVENT_CARRIER_CATAPULT

comments from developer for latest available realization - from 2.5.1
For takeoff from carrier:

 1. Add connector "launch_bar_point" to nose gearpost connect point to catapult shuttle. Use draw argument 85 for launch bar animation.

 2. Catch the event after born on carrier with catapult (use ed_fm_push_simulation_event) 
 you can use it for example to init launch bar state

 in.event_type = ED_FM_EVENT_CARRIER_CATAPULT 
 in.event_params[0] = 1; 

 3. Catapult will ask you start conditions (throttle or thrust has takeoff value), so throw the event any time that conditions changed:

 out.event_type = ED_FM_EVENT_CARRIER_CATAPULT 
 out.event_params[0] = (1 if ready for takeoff, 0 if not) 


 and here you can give additional params for physics (if not or zero - then default):

 out.event_params[1] = 3; //start delay [sec] 
 out.event_params[2] = 67; //required velocity after takeoff [meters per sec] (+ with safety reserve; func of mass) 
 out.event_params[3] = 0.5*9.8*mass; //mean engines thrust during takeoff [N] (func of mass) 

 without this event catapult is waiting for afterburner flag

 4. Catch the event after start running if you want:

 in.event_type = ED_FM_EVENT_CARRIER_CATAPULT 
 in.event_params[0] = 2; 

 5. Catch the event after end of running (leaving carrier) if you want:

 in.event_type = ED_FM_EVENT_CARRIER_CATAPULT 
 in.event_params[0] = 3; 


 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 For landing to carrier:

 1. Add connector "hook_point" to the end of hook. Use draw argument 25 for hook animation.
 
 2. Add the segment element "HOOK" to collision model.

 -- from 2.7.1

 3. Catch the event after hooked the rope (success landing on carrier) if you want:

 in.event_type = ED_FM_EVENT_CARRIER_HOOKED
 in.event_params[0] = 1;
 
 4. Throw the event is you need to unhooked:

 out.event_type = ED_FM_EVENT_CARRIER_HOOKED
 out.event_params[0] = 0; (that means that main condition for hooking is false - rope's phys will disappear immediately, if = 1 - nothing will change)

 5. Catch the event after unhooking (finished or canceled) if you want:

 in.event_type = ED_FM_EVENT_CARRIER_HOOKED
 in.event_params[0] = 2;
